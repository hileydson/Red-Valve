# Maycow Lopes: The Last Executioner
# The Man Behind the Mask
Maycow Lopes wasn't supposed to be a hero; he was a "Sanitizer." In the corporate-run colonies of the outer rim, Sanitizers are high-end mercenaries hired to "clean up" failed experiments or worker uprisings that the company wants to keep off the books.

Born on a high-gravity industrial moon, Maycow has a constitution as tough as the steel he walks on. He is a man of few words, preferring the rhythmic grinding of his gears to the screams of the dying. His face is hidden behind a protective gaiter—some say to filter the toxic spores of Acheron V, others say because he can no longer bear to see his own reflection in a reality that is breaking.

# The Descent into Acheron V
Maycow was hired by the corporate shadows of the Red-Valve Corporation under a simple premise: Enter Station Acheron V and neutralize the "Biological Instability." However, upon arrival, Maycow realized he was lied to. The "instability" wasn't a virus; it was a cosmic rupture. As a man who values cold, hard logic and solid machinery, the "impossible geometries" of the station are an insult to his very existence. He doesn't just kill the cultists because it's his job—he kills them because their existence defies the laws of the universe he knows.

# The Burden of the Gears
Maycow carries the Crescent Cogblade over his shoulder like a heavy cross. To him, the weapon is a symbol of the station’s fall—a tool of creation turned into a dealer of death. While most men would have lost their minds seeing the walls turn into eyes, Maycow maintains a "Stubborn Sanity." He treats the cosmic horror like a mechanical malfunction: if it’s broken, you hit it until it stops moving.

# The Silent Twist
Deep down, Maycow knows the truth about his mission. He knows his ship is a bomb. He knows he is a "disposable asset." But instead of fleeing, he chooses to go deeper. His personal code—The Mercenary’s Contract—demands he sees the job through to the end, even if the "end" means pulling the trigger on a dark matter charge that will dissolve his very atoms into pixels.

# Character Traits & Gameplay Identity
The Iron Will: Unlike the miners, Maycow's mind is exceptionally "rigid." This makes him resistant to the Threshold Guardian’s whispers, but it also means the visual distortions of the Sanity Mechanic manifest as aggressive, sharp glitches in his vision.

The Gear-Head: Maycow can "tune" his weapons. He treats the Acheron Sentinel and the Cogblade with religious care, oiling them with the black ichor of his enemies to keep them from jamming in the warped reality.

Aesthetic: He represents the Grey and Brown of the old world, a somber shadow moving through a world of Neon Purple and Green madness.

# A Quote from Maycow's Journal:
"The Company told me Acheron V was a mining station. They forgot to mention what they were actually digging for. I’ve seen men turn into shapes that shouldn't have names. I’ve seen the steel bleed. My contract says I get paid upon completion... but looking at the sky through that rift, I don't think there's going to be anyone left to sign the check. Doesn't matter. The gears are turning. The blade is sharp. Let's finish this."
