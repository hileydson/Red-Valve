# Enemy Name: The Cobalt Husker

# Description

The Cobalt Husker is a terrifying manifestation of a miner whose physical form has been completely overwritten by the "Impossible Geometry" found in the mines. Standing taller than a human, its body is composed of jagged, obsidian-like rock and translucent organic fibers.

Its most striking features are the six glowing "vent ports" on its chest—exposed ribs that pulse with a sickening pink-violet light—and the massive, blackened horns that act as lightning rods for extra-dimensional energy. It doesn't walk so much as it glitches through space, surrounded by a faint, ghostly vapor of pulverized reality.

# Lore: "The First to Gaze"

Before the Acheron V went silent, the Huskers were the elite deep-drilling unit. They were the ones who first broke through the geode containing the "pulsing mineral."

The lore suggests that these weren't killed by the entity; they were recrafted. The "Red Valve"—the station's main pressure regulation system—began pumping not steam, but a gaseous form of the mineral. As the miners inhaled it, their bones hardened into black stone and their minds were unified into a single, screaming consciousness.

The Cobalt Husker now haunts the ventilation shafts and dark corridors of the station. It views the player not as an intruder to be killed, but as "raw material" that hasn't been properly folded into the new geometry yet.
