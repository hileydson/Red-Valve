# The Acheron Sentinel: "The Negotiator"
# Background

This was the standard-issue sidearm for high-ranking security officers at Mining Station Acheron V. When Maycow Lopes was deployed as a mercenary, he recovered it from the holster of a fallen officer in the station's upper tiers. Originally, it was a purely functional tool of steel and polymer, but prolonged exposure to the "impossible geometries" deep within the mantle has begun to transmute the metal itself.

# Biomechanical Fusion
Unlike the Crescent Cogblade, which feels brutal and mechanical, the Sentinel has absorbed the terrifying elegance of the pulsing minerals found in the rock's deepest mantle.

The Runes: The inscriptions along the slide appeared spontaneously. Maycow claims that in moments of absolute silence, he can hear the weapon whispering these runes into his mind.

Ether Gems: The emerald-green details on the grip and barrel are purified fragments of the translucent mineral. They act as "reality stabilizers," allowing Maycow's bullets to strike entities that are partially phased out of our dimension.

# Synergy with Maycow Lopes
To Maycow, this gun is a compass. He nicknamed it "The Negotiator" because it’s the only thing the cultists seem to listen to. As the station's purple neon lights distort his vision and the walls begin to grow "eyes," the steady green glow of the pistol anchors him to the "here and now."

# Gameplay & Attributes
Type: High-impact semi-automatic.

Ether-Rifled Barrel: Each shot leaves a trail of neon green light. Enemies hit by the Sentinel are "tethered" to our reality, preventing Geometric Aberrations from teleporting or turning invisible for several seconds.

Sanity Recharge: Every confirmed headshot emits a pulse of green light that briefly clears the visual distortions on Maycow's HUD, restoring a small portion of his mental clarity.

The Hum: If Maycow runs out of ammunition, the gun begins to vibrate violently. This increases the attack speed of his melee weapon, the Crescent Cogblade, as if the pistol is feeding its "hunger" through the blade.

# Audio Log Fragment (Maycow Lopes):

"Command sent me here with a disposable assault rifle, but this beauty is what kept me breathing. She glows when those things get close. Sometimes I feel the grip warming up against my palm, like it’s trying to give me a warning... or advice. At the end of the day, it's the only thing on this godforsaken rock that still points in the right direction."
