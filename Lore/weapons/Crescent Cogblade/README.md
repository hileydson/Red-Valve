# Crescent Cogblade: The Relic of Impure Geometry
# Origin
Originally, the Cogblade was not a weapon, but a high-torque hydraulic precision tool used by Acheron V’s elite engineers to slice through the ultra-dense mineral veins of the asteroid's mantle. Its intricate gear system was designed to multiply rotational force, allowing the crescent blade to vibrate at frequencies capable of shattering solid rock.

# The Corruption
When reality fractured, the Cogblade was the first tool to "evolve". The Chisel Cultists believe the gears began turning on their own—powered not by electricity, but by the rhythmic pulses emanating from the translucent minerals.

Before they gouged out their eyes, the miners etched the ornate runes seen at the base of the blade. They claimed the metal required "language" to understand its new, divine purpose: severing the flesh from the soul.

# Gameplay Mechanics
In Red-Valve, the Crescent Cogblade serves as your primary melee defense:

Primary Attack: A heavy horizontal swing. The gears grind loudly, spitting sparks and black oil.

Secondary Attack (Heavy): The player engages the internal motor. The crescent blade spins like a circular saw for a few seconds—perfect for carving through Geometric Aberrations that ignore standard ballistics.

Sanity Synergy: As your health drops and the world distorts, the blade’s gears begin to glow with a neon purple hue. The lower your sanity, the higher the critical damage, as the weapon "aligns" with the encroaching dimensions.

# In-Game Audio Log (Found near the Excavation Site):
"Engineer H. Vance - Log 402: I can't stop the gears anymore. The motor is cold, the cables are severed, but they... they just keep turning. It’s a rhythmic sound, like a prayer. Yesterday, I saw a miner kissing the blade. He said the angle of the crescent is the only thing that makes sense anymore. I should throw it in the incinerator, but the metal is so... mesmerizing."
